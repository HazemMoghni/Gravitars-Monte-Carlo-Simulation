# Gravitars MCS
This is a gravitars Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) that uses the probability density functions (PDFs) of four variables: initial space, initial rotation periods, age, and ellipticity. Treating the gravitars as triaxial ellipsoids with zero inclination angle and zero translational movement, I estimate their detectability.
